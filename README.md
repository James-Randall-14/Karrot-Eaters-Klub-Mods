# Karrot-Eaters-Klub-Mods
This is the GitHub repository for the most up to date version of the Karrot Eaters Klub modpack.
It's very close to vanilla.

To install, just clone this repository and move it into your minecraft directory.
For the first time installation, it's easier just to download the modpack from Drive:

This repository is really only for when there is a small update that doesn't break anything, but doesn't warrant a re-update of the modpack.
