# Karrot-Eaters-Klub-Mods
This is the GitHub repository for the most up to date version of the Karrot Eaters Klub modpack.
It's very close to vanilla.

Obligatory I didn't create any of these mods, shaders, resourcepacks, etc... I just packaged them together.
If you don't know me personally, this modpack isn't for you.
That doesn't mean you can't use it, just know that I'm not the creator of anything included in this repo.

To install, just clone this repository and move it into your minecraft directory.
For the first time installation, it's easier just to download the modpack from Drive:

This repository is really only for when there is a small update that doesn't break anything, but doesn't warrant a re-update of the modpack.

Also, this repository includes some of my personal settings, like my shaders and keybinds. Use them if you want to, but they're mostly for my my convenience.
